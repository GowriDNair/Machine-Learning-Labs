# Machine_Learning_Labs
Machine learning labs completed in the fourth semester. Learned to build preprocessing pipelines, implement regression models, create decision trees, and more. Model performances were evaluated using confusion matrices and a variety of metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
